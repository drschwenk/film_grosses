### Design draft format

By end of w2d1 (Jan 20, 2015), you should be able to complete the following form for your project. However, keep in mind that throughout the design iterations of your project, many parts of it will likely change (i.e. increase/decrease in number of movies, types of characteristics, etc), so this is just a starting point.

####Client: 
My client is a movie studio responsoble for several successful movie franchises.

####Client's question/need: 
The studio is taking stock of a previosuly successful franchise. The most recent film in the series did not perform as well as expected, and they are questioning whether to make another film. They would like help identifiying factors that make a franchise successful long term. They are also considering the possibility of rebooting the franchise.

####Description of my sample of movies: 
I will start with the Top Series Movies (Trilogy, tetralogy, etc.) list generated by IMDB. I will likely look at less succesful series as the project progresses. 

####Characteristics of each movie:
Consistency of cast and creatives over the series of movies.
Length of time between individual movies.
Genre
Success of first film
Critical reception
